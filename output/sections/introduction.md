# Introduction

Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers affecting women worldwide, with early detection being crucial for improving patient outcomes. Recent advances in deep learning have shown remarkable potential in medical image analysis, particularly in mammogram interpretation. Previous studies have demonstrated that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve performance comparable to or even exceeding that of expert radiologists (Zhang et al., 2023). However, several challenges remain, including the need for large annotated datasets and the interpretability of model decisions.

The primary aim of this study is to develop and validate a deep learning-based system for breast cancer detection using mammographic images. Specifically, we seek to: (1) evaluate the diagnostic performance of our proposed model; (2) compare its accuracy with existing methods; and (3) assess its potential clinical applicability. This research addresses a critical gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of AI-assisted diagnosis in a large, multi-center dataset.

Our findings have significant implications for clinical practice. The high accuracy and sensitivity demonstrated by our model suggest that AI systems could serve as valuable second readers in mammography screening, potentially improving detection rates while reducing radiologist workload. Furthermore, the interpretability features incorporated into our system enable radiologists to understand and validate AI predictions, facilitating trust and adoption in clinical settings.
